# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
Once a user is logged in they can view their shortened urls. On the Edit page for each URL one can view analytics of how many times a given short url was visited, how many UNIQUE visitors visited and a list of every visit.

I added method-override middleware to make PUT and DELETE requests in the server file.
